# Business Proposal for "Surf's Up: ice Cream and Surfboards"
=============================================================

## Analysis: 
------------

  In order to secure investment from W. Avy, who would like more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

  ### Tools used:
        * SQlite: 
          * A version of SqL that lives on a computer or phone
          * Smaller and faster and doesn't have users
        * SQLAlchemy:
          * A query tool for SQLite
        * Flask:
          * A web framework that uses Python to build web pages
          
## Results:

  1. The Temperature average in Oahu, Hawaii remain within comfortable ranges.  The average temperature in June is 74.94 and the average temperature in December is 71.04.  Showing us that if the weather is clear and sunny it is great weather to sell ice cream year round.   

  2. The month of December varies much more than June with minimum temperatures of 56 and maximum of 83.  This tells us to expect sales to flucuate greatly in the month of December.

  3. The Precipitation chart above shows that we can see that June and December are low precipitation months but we can expect heavier rainfall in Spetember and March.  This means that while ice cream sales may slow the sale of surf accessories may increase.  


## Summary:
-----------
  After reviewing this analysis of the weather data we can see that Oahu is a great location of our business.  With moderate temeratures and rainfall that will help conditions for surfing I confidently recommend construction begin as soon as possible.  Selling ice cream while temperatures are between 70 and 80 degrees means that it will be quite warm and ice cream will be a great treat for tourists and the local surfing community alike.  Also by providing surfing accessories like boards, wax, and clothing we can provide the community with supplies year round.  Of course with foot traffic coming in for one reason it gives our sales staff ample oppurtunites to sell other products to our customers.  
    Some other weather data we may want to query would be tides, letting us find out which monthss have the greatest swells.  And also the temperature based on time, which would let us know more accurately the best hours to be open.  By knowing the tides and the temperature by time we can see when would be best for sales on old stock and when to get ready for slower sales months.  
    As we can see from the weather analysis and our previous business plan Oahu would be a perfect choice for starting our venture.  I look forward to hearing any questions you have and as initially reported I would be more than glad to be on site everyday to make sure operations run smoothly.  
    Thank you for your time and I look forward to your resonse on our future partnership.
